# Algorithm Practice using Python

I've been solving problems on various sites such as http://rosalind.info/, https://projecteuler.net/, https://codesignal.com/, and https://www.codewars.com/ since early last year and most of my solutions have been created in random .py files and submitted to the respective sites. I've decided that it's worthwhile to submit my solutions here on GitHub, so from now on I will push each solution to this repo with the question origin referenced and an explanation of my thought process for said solution.
